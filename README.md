#### Continuation of Udacity project
This project has been finished previously using Alteryx analytics software as project work for Udacity's Predictive Analytics for Business nanodegree.  
We will go through this project again with Python using scikit-learn and see how similarly our linear regression model performs on different platorm. 

### Overview

In this project, we will analyze a fictional business problem in the mail-order catalog business. Weâ€™re tasked with predicting how much money this company can expect to earn from sending out a catalog to new customers.

This task will involve building a linear regression model with scikit-learn and applying the results in order to provide a recommendation to this fictional management.

We have two excel files to work with:  
    1. customers.xlsx - existing customers  
    2. mailinglist.xlsx - new customers 

### The Business Problem

*Determine how much profit a company can expect from sending a catalog to new customers. Management does not want to send the catalog out to these new customers unless the expected profit contribution exceeds $10,000.*

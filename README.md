### Overview

In this project, we will analyze a fictional business problem in the mail-order catalog business. We’re tasked with predicting how much money this company can expect to earn from sending out a catalog to new customers. The task and data is from Udacity’s Predictive Analytics for Business nanodegree program.

This task will involve building a linear regression model in python with scikit-learn and applying the results in order to provide a recommendation to this fictional management.

I also wrote a blog post [here](https://hhook.github.io/2020/08/predicting-catalog-demand-with-scikit-learn/) documenting my analysis process, topic modeling, and findings.
